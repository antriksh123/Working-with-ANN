# Working-with-ANN
This repository contains three projects related to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Each project focuses on a different application of ANNs and demonstrates their effectiveness in solving real-world problems.

## Bank Customer Churn Prediction 
In this project, we develop an ANN model to predict customer churn in a bank. Customer churn is when customers stop doing business with a company. By analyzing factors such as customer demographics, transaction history, and behavior, we train an ANN model to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the bank. This information can help the bank proactively retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Handwritten Digit Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision. In this project, we build an ANN model to identify handwritten digits from images accurately. We train the model on a large dataset of handwritten digits and then test its performance on unseen data. The model's ability to recognize numbers can have various applications, including digitizing handwritten documents, automating postal services, and enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals.

## Predicting the Energy Output of a power plant
In this project, we explore the use of ANNs to predict the energy output of a power plant. By analyzing factors such as temperature, pressure, and humidity, we develop an ANN model that can estimate the power plant's energy output. This prediction can be valuable for power plant operators to optimize their operations, plan maintenance activities, and make informed decisions about energy production.

Each project folder contains the necessary jupyter notebook and datasets.
